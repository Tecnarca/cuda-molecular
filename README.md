# Cuda Molecular
GPU implementation, with CUDA C, of an algorithm to compute the optimal shape for a molecule composed of a certain number of fragments and atoms. See:
- [Code](https://github.com/Tecnarca/cuda-molecular/tree/master/src)
- [Project presentation](https://github.com/Tecnarca/cuda-molecular/blob/master/presentation.pdf)

Benchmarks were made on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX970, exploiting CUDA10 new features.
